i am still not sure which of the two came up with the idea of the underground archive it will have appealed to black as a way to provide security to his operation but a civil engineering project of this scale doesnt seem like his sort of thing so i think it must have been conceived by charles grey the first tube line had been opened in and london was full of labourers and engineers with the skills needed to build the shadow archive deep beneath new scotland yard getting access was not going to be easy without harrys help but i still didnt have enough to give him the excuse he would need to get openly involved my reconnaissance had helped me to find the archive but it didnt give me any obvious way in the duct that had cost me the lidar was far too narrow for me to scale and access through the front door was too risky so i took a gamble and spent another miserable fortnight exploring the labyrinth of sewers and tunnel systems around the neighbourhood gps was useless down there and i could easily have got lost but i marked the tunnels and on occasions used theseus trick of a ball of twine to help me navigate back i moved quietly and kept an eye out for sensors i had no idea whether the shadow archive was still operational or not but if it was then security would be tight and i couldnt be sure if they were using infrared or seismometers for intrusion detection so i layered up with insulation and moved slowly it was horrible i was hot damp and the air smelled of sewage and mould i was just about to give up when i found a steel door marked with the initials vri victoria regina imperatrix it was incongruous in that dark and dank tunnel but more significantly it carried the trademark tann on the lock john tann was one of the top safe makers in victorian london and i had cracked one or two of his safes in my other life as a cat burglar this was big and heavy and very rusty that told me two things noone had used it in a very long time and noone had upgraded it in just as long if the room behind it was still in use then someone would have been maintaining the lock so all my precautions were probably unnecessary but noone had paid for a tann safe without something important to hide so i decided to tackle the lock and after another eighteen hours of grim work i was in i had found the shadow archive
